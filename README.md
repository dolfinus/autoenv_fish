# autoenv_fish

[Autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) magic for [fish shell](https://fishshell.com)!

Please note that this proejct is intended to make autoenv available for fish shell users, this basically means that this version will always be a bit behind the main project. Any bugs, bugfixes and contributions are very much appreciated, but keep in mind that any feature requests (unless strictly fish-related) should be posted [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv/issues).
